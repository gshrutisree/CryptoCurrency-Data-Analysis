ðŸ“Š**Data Visualization**

This project includes several visualizations for understanding cryptocurrency trends:

- Price Trends Over Time: Line plots to visualize daily price movements.
- Volume Analysis: Charts to see trading volume over the specified period.
- Correlation Analysis: Heatmaps to study the relationship between different crypto pairs.

ðŸ¤– **Machine Learning**

The ml_model.py script includes:
- Data Preprocessing: Preparing historical data for machine learning models.
- Model Training: Utilizing algorithms like linear regression or decision trees to predict future prices.
- Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy based on test data.

ðŸ“¦ **Dataset**

The dataset includes historical data for various cryptocurrency pairs, including:
- Date
- Opening Price
- Closing Price
- Highest Price
- Lowest Price
- Trading Volume

Data is fetched and saved in multiple formats:
- Excel File: data/cryptocurrency_data.xlsx
- CSV File: data/data1.csv
